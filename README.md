# COS-132-Imperative-Programming
COS 132 is a Computer Science Module at the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/yearbooks/2024/EBIT-faculty/UG-modules/view/COS%20132)


The focus is on object-oriented (OO) programming. Concepts including inheritance and multiple inheritance,
polymorphism, operator overloading, memory management (static and dynamic binding), interfaces,
encapsulation, reuse, etc. will be covered in the module. The module teaches sound program design with the
emphasis on modular code, leading to well structured, robust and documented programs. A modern OO
programming language is used as the vehicle to develop these skills. The module will introduce the student to
basic data structures, lists, stacks and queues
